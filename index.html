        <p> We’re media people who live and work in the entertainment world – not on just anything that pays the bills from chocolate bars to electric cars, grocery shops to flip flops, or crampons to tampons. We’re truly independent so we’re not here to ‘create shareholder value’ or to cross sell ‘group services’. We don’t make money through side hustles, rebates, mark-ups, backhanders, 3rd party ‘specialists’ or phantom payments. We’re owner managed so you see the organ grinders – not monkeys - and we treat our client’s budget as if it were our own. We know where every single penny goes and what it needs to achieve – we learn from everything we do, together, as a team. We do the right thing because it’s the right thing to do and it means we can sleep soundly at night. We do this because we want to work with people like us – passionate experts who want to make a difference and do great things. If you like the cut of our jib then maybe we can do great things together.</p>

            way that we often fail to appreciate: it opens

            and enlightens and permits things that might
            otherwise have seemed unthinkable”</h1>
